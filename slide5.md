### Configure Dynamic Credentials
<font size=4>

Using dynamic credentials in a workspace requires the following steps for each cloud platform:

1. **Set up a Trust Relationship**: You must configure a relationship between Terraform Cloud and the AWS cloud platform. 
2. **Configure Cloud Platform Access**: You must configure roles and policies for the cloud platform to define the workspaceâ€™s access to infrastructure resources.
3. **Configure Terraform Cloud Workspace**: You must add specific environment variables to your workspace to tell Terraform Cloud how to authenticate to the other cloud platform during plans and applies.
