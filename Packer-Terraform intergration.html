# Agenda

1. Unified Workflow with Terraform Cloud
2. Terraform Cloud and HCP Packer Working together
3. Integrated build & provisioning workflow

Packer is HashiCorp's tool for creating machine images from source configuration. 
You can configure Packer images with an operating system and software for your specific use-case.
Terraform configuration for a compute instance can use a Packer image to provision your instance without manual configuration. 
Terraform Cloud and HCP Packer is a great “better together” story

# Terraform Cloud and HCP Packer Working Together

  HCP Packer                                 
● Build images                          
● Publish metadata                      
● Release via channels                 
● Revoke and rollback
● View ancestry & history

  Terraform Cloud
● Fetch images (Data source)
● Provision infrastructure
● Validate image status (Run tasks, continuous validation)

Terraform Cloud and HCP Packer is a great working together soloution 
It’s the perfect extension for customers who are already using Terraform
you can build these images with Packer OSS then publish the metadata of these images to the Packer Registry 
Then you can promote or assign these images for different environments via channels 
And this is how our downstream consumers know which image to consume 
In the mix of things, we are doing revocation and roll back when necessary 
And now we have this new view into ancestry and channel assignment history of images as well 
So we get the whole image lifecycle with Packer and HCP Packer 
Terraform will fetch these images using the data source in the HCP Provider that will be querying the channels to get the correct Image ID
Terraform will provision infrastructure based on these images
Terraform Cloud and HCP Packer intergtate through "RunTask" and Continous validation to ensure correct image is being provisioned
