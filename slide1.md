# What is Consul Service Catalog?

![scale:50%](./assets/images/consul-logo-url-trans.png)

Service discovery in Consul helps you discover, track, and monitor the health of services within a network. 

Service discovery registers and maintains a record of all your services in a **service catalog**, a single source of truth that allows your services to query and communicate with each other.
